## Setting Up

To run this locally on your system, clone the repo to your local machine and start by doing a `python -m venv venv`. Note: You need to have python installed on your system already. After it has finishing creating your virtual environment, you activate it by doing a `. venv/bin/activate` and you use pip to install the packages `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After that has done processing, you create a .env file and copy the values from the [dummy.env](dummy.env) file and paste it into the .env file

```terminal
